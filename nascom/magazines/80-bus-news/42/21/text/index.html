<p>
later, so my first library file was made up of the bits
of LU, including the documentation. No I didn&rsquo;t
then erase LU from the system disk, it stayed there
until I wanted to use it, then the problem. The
documentation was in the library, and I couldn&rsquo;t
remember the syntax to make it work. After about
half an hour trying all the tricks I could think of that
wouldn&rsquo;t take too long, (including trying to load the
library into a debugger but it was too big) I resorted
to phoneing Richard who promptly reminded me
that all commands are prefixed with a &lsquo;&minus;&rsquo;. That
solved the problem and away I went.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for LU is &lsquo;something else&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s
32K long, and if you reckon I go on a bit, you should
try reading the LU documentation! I think the
command summary should take up about half a
page, after all there are only 9 simple commands.
And perhaps another page of warnings, tricks, etc.
That&rsquo;s about 4K at best. I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve read all the
guff that came with LU, so perhaps I&rsquo;ve missed the
one vital command which gives you a list of
commands from inside the program, but I doubt if
there is one.
</p>
<p>
To give an idea of space saving with LU, take my
dBASE master disks, there&rsquo;s five in all and tot up to
about 900K (allocated on 4K blocks). Squeeze all
that lot using SOQ or SWEEP brings it down to about
700K. Then shove the squeezed file into a library,
the library ended up at about 330K. In fact I got the
whole of dBASE 2.41 and dBASE 2.43 on to the
same disk with room to spare. So the space saving
with LU was quite fantastic.
</p>
<p>
The other problem LU cures is getting things mixed
up. Lots of different suites of programs have a
program call <span class="uppercase">Install</span> (or other similarly named
files). Try running the wrong install on a program,
and brother, have you got problems. Previously I
kept different suites of programs on different disk
user areas, but this still wasted space. With LU, all
the different parts of a suite of programs are all
tucked away in one file and can&rsquo;t get lost or mixed
up.
</p>
<h4 id="article1">
VIRUS
</h4>
<p>
Back to the wasted space at the end of a block in a
CP/M directory, someone came up with a real lulu
of an evil idea. I don&rsquo;t know how far he went with
the idea, for all I know, it might be out there lurking,
but it should have been {or will be} a real block
buster if it&rsquo;s ever done.
</p>
<p>
The program was to be called VIRUS, and like a
virus, it was to be self propagating and infect the
world silently until the symptoms struck an
unsuspecting world computer population almost at
once. The idea goes something like this:
</p>
<p>
VIRUS is introduced into an executable file by the
perpetrator of the crime, and that file is given to
someone else. The next time that program is
executed, the program loads into the TPA as usual,
but before the program executes, VIRUS executes
first, because the start jump of the program has
been changed to VIRUS instead of the program.
VIRUS throws a random number and goes and gets
a directory entry from the unsuspecting persons
disk. VIRUS then checks four things, first that the
directory entry is a .COM file, secondly it has a start
jump (most CP/M programs have, and if it has
VIRUS saves it), third, that there is space at the end
of the last block for VIRUS to lurk (could be difficult
that, but a clever programmer could probably crack
it), and fourth, VIRUS is not already resident in that
space.
</p>
<p>
Given that all four conditions are satisfied, VIRUS
copies itself into the wasted space at the end of the
last block using the CP/M&nbsp;2.2 random access
ability, changes the start jump to itself and changes
its exit jump to the jump at the start of the program
so the program will execute after VIRUS. One last
thing. In copying itself, it decrements an internal
counter by one.
</p>
<p>
Get the idea, VIRUS has now infected another
program. Next time either that program or the
previous program is executed, VIRUS will infect
another program and so on. The infection process
would only take a few tenths of a second, and the
user would be totally unaware of what was
happening. So the guy with infected disks gives a
copy of some program to another person, who also
catches VIRUS, who in turn passes it to someone
else. All the time the counters are decrementing.
</p>
<p>
When the counters get to zero, the program refuses
to run and up pops a message:
</p>
<pre class="uppercase">
Your Program Has Virus.  Send  &pound;5.00 to
P.O. Box 1 Brighton For Decontamination Program!
</pre>
<p>
If the counters were set to a fairly large number,
and VIRUS were introduced into the right places,
like NASTUG and the Merseyside Users Group, the
natural process of swapping disks between folks
could go on for some considerable time before the
symptoms break. Exit our hero with a small fortune
and a lot of angry guys on his tail. Angry guys? Yes
probably, as VIRUS would have infected proprietory
programs as well as rip-offs. And as for chasing
him, well I&rsquo;ll be one jump ahead of the pack, &rsquo;cos I
know whose idea it was in the first place. Nice
thought though.
</p>

The Gemini GM870 MODEM
</h4>
<p>
They&rsquo;ve arrived at last. The Gemini
<!-- External Link --><a href="https://80bus.co.uk.mirror.jloh.de/pages/gemini/gm870.htm" title="External Link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GM870</a><!-- /External Link -->
MODEM cards that is. What a delight, both for me and
<i>BT</i>. Me because I&rsquo;d been waiting for one for some
time, and <i>BT</i> because my usually frugal phone bill
has been taking a walloping.
</p>
<p>
So what do you get? An all &lsquo;bells and whistles&rsquo;
auto-dial, auto-answer MODEM all on one card
