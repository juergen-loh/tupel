division didn&rsquo;t exactly go a bundle on the &lsquo;stuck up twits&rsquo;
in the computer division (their description, not mine). When
we told the typewriter division just how unhelpful the
computer lot were, the typewriter guys bent over backwards
to provide all the stuff we needed.
</p>
<p>
More recently, a number of medium priced (500.00 to
600.00 price bracket), medium duty daisy wheel printers have
become available, mostly from the Far East. Brother, the
Japanese typewriter people (is it the same as the sewing
machine and knitting machine company?) have a number of
daisy wheel computer printers with or without keyboards in
all price brackets except the very lowest. Of the Brother
machines the best way to describe them is &lsquo;average&rsquo;, you
seem to get what you pay for. None are exceptional for the
price, but all seem to be provided with the facilities that
you might expect from the competition at a similar price.
Qume, Olivetti, Triumph Adler, Tec and many others have
followed the lead with machines in this bracket. But these
are still too expensive for the home and small business
user.
</p>
<p>
The Juki 6100 (I might have the number wrong, but the
one you can get for about 300.00) is a very nice machine.
Not fast, but a well built mechanism and very precise
character registration. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is the
choice of wheels and ribbons. Now I&rsquo;m all for
standardisation is this area. I recently came across a
&lsquo;Kores&rdquo; printer ribbon catalogue (trade bible), and there
are about 600 different types of cassette ribbon in the
catalogue. About half of these are visually similar, but bet
your bottom dollar, a ribbon for one machine which looks
almost like a ribbon for another won&rsquo;t fit. The same applies
to daisy wheels, there is a bit more standardisation here,
put a growing trend for each printer manufacturer to make
his own unique wheel for his printer. Like I says, the Juki
have chosen Triumph Adler wheels and ribbons for their
printer. On the face of it a very sensible idea, as these
are the wheels and ribbons used by the Triumph Adler office
typewriters, and so, should be available at your local
stationers. Well I tried our local branch of a big chain
stationer, and yes, they had them. The snag? The price. 6.00
for a ribbon and 22.00 for an ordinary plastic daisy wheel.
I tried the local Indian stationers, he was a bit cheaper
for the ribbons, 5.50, but didn&rsquo;t have the wheels. What a
rip-off!!.
</p>
<p>
Two daisy wheel printers have recently come under my
scrutinization, and having given then an intense scrute, I
will now pronounce myself!! The Sanple Daisy Step 2000 and
the almost identical (but not quite) Quen-Data printer. Both
printers cost about 225.00 and both are Qume clones in all
but speed and quality of construction. Actually, Quen might
just be a Far Eastern misspelling for Qume, who knows.
Anyway, both use Qume wheels, which are cheap at about 5.50
to 6.00. and available in a vast range of type styles and
pitches (if you can only find someone who actually keeps
more than just a couple of types), and the carbon
multistrike ribbons are cheap at about 3.00 and seem to last
for ever.
</p>
<p>
Both printers have a Centronics interface with a 256
character buffer. The Sanple has a serial RS232 option at
about 55.00 with a 2K buffer. The Quen probably has a serial
option available, but I haven&rsquo;t yet discovered for sure or
how much. The printer control protocols are a superset of
the Qume Sprint 5, and being a superset have a few extras
thrown in, for example software selectable bidirectional
logic seeking printing, selectable hammer strike pressure,
etc. Printing speeds are about 20 characters per second with
high speed skipping of white space. All the internal
software seems to work without bugs, and although slow, the
print output is of very good quality.
</p>
<p>
What about the mechanism? Well it&rsquo;s Ok so long as you
keep the lid shut and don&rsquo;t look too closely. Pressed steel
chassis, guides and runners where the Qume has a diecast
aluminium chassis and precision ground steel guides and
runners. The carriage is poorly located on the guides with
nylon carriage slides. By contrast the Qume has phosphor
bronze bushings for the front guides and sprung ball races
for the rear. A not so subtle difference between the Qume
mechanism on the one hand, and the Sanple and Quen on the
other. Mind you the price difference isn&rsquo;t so subtle either,
the Qume costs nearly ten times as much as the other two.
<!--/p-->
<!-- 2(2) columns: change -->
<!--p-->
The point is that both these cheap printers work, and work
well. There can be no doubt that they won&rsquo;t stay working as
long as the Qume, but then in a home environment, that sort
of longevity isn&rsquo;t required. These two are DRH&rsquo;s best buy at
the moment.

<h3 id="article1">
<u>And so on to other things</u>
</h3>
<p>
I&rsquo;ve spent some time doing some late spring cleaning
amongst my disks and in the process came across a nice
little program by Ward Christensen. Now for those who aren&rsquo;t
devotees of the various CP/M User Groups, Ward Christensen
is a software writer of some renown and greater output. You
could be forgiven for thinking that he has single handedly
written all the software on all the couple of hundred US
CP/M User Group disks. He hasn&rsquo;t, but his name must
certainly appear more often than most. Anyway, <span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> is a
neat little encryption program for scrambling the text or
code of a disk file. I liked the program so I spent a little
time doing a little tidy here and a little tidy there just
to provide fodder for those who like to find DRH&rsquo;s
deliberate mistakes. Now I&rsquo;ll not take the blame for all the
mistakes, only the ones I&rsquo;ve committed, as the source code
came to me as a Z80 source program. Now I haven&rsquo;t yet seen a
Ward Christensen program written in Z80, it&rsquo;s always <!-- External Link --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080" title="External Link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">8080</a><!-- /External Link -->
assembler, so someone has translated the file, and possibly
done goodness knows what else in the process. So with no
more said, I&rsquo;ll re-print Ward&rsquo;s original DOC file here, and
the source will appear somewhere else in this mag.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;<span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> is a command used to encode a CP/M f&rsquo;
</p>
<p>
The format of the command is:
</p>
<h4 class="center">
&ldquo;<span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> filename.type password&rdquo;
</h4>
<p class="continued">
where &ldquo;password&rdquo; is an 8 character password made of
characters permissible in a file name (i.e. no &ldquo;.&rdquo;, etc).
To obtain a good &ldquo;initial seed&rdquo; for the scrambling process,
no character in the password may appear more than twice.
</p>
<p>
The requested file is scrambled, and re-written in
place. To unscramble the file, the <span class="uppercase">Identical</span> command is
issued, i.e:
</p>
<p>
&gt;<span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> filename.type password
</p>
<p class="continued">
This is because <span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> does an &ldquo;exclusive-or&rdquo; type
modification to the file, and doing two identical exclusive-or&rsquo;s
to data result in the same data being returned.
</p>
<p>
I feel a scrambled file is quite secure. Given that a
file was scrambled and the password forgotten, I know of no
way to determine what the original file was. Even a file
which is all binary-0&rsquo;s, is sufficiently scrambled to defy
finding out what the password or original data was. &hellip;But
I assume no responsibility for the &ldquo;security&rdquo; of files
scrambled with <span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> as I am not a &ldquo;student of
cryptology&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Note also, that if an attempt is made to unscramble a
scrambled file, using the WRONG password, then the file is
technically &ldquo;double scrambled&rdquo; and <span class="uppercase">Scramble</span> would then have
to be executed TWICE, once with the original password, and
once with the erroniously-used password. Because of the
exclusive or-ing process, either password may be used either
time.
</p>

<h3>
<u>Comms Software</u>
</h3>
<p>
Following Ward&rsquo;s Scramble, I&rsquo;ve had a letter from Arto
Liimatta in Finland, who has thrown all the beautiful and
complicated &rsquo;comms software out of the window and come up
with a very simple patch to PIP.COM to make it communicate
with another PIP on another machine, suggested by an article
in &ldquo;Microsystems&rdquo; July 1983. As he writes,
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I also put here one program PIP, and how to use it for
transfering data between maschines. It uses some kind of
handshaking in the transmitting procedure, so the receiving
maschine won&rsquo;t lost data, while it is saving it to disk. The
transmitting computer sends a character and when the
receiving computer gets it, it echoes it back to the
transmitter who then knows the receiver is ready. When the
receiver is not ready it does not echo until it is ready to
receive. I think it has been used for many years, but I
haven&rsquo;t seen it yet in 80-BUS News.&rdquo;
