 chip with double sided, foamed, particularly tenacious sticky
tape, making for tidy mechanical assembly. On test the clock functioned
perfectly.
</p>
<p>
The clock is provided with a trimmer for setting the onboard crystal to
exactly 32.768KHz, however, no advice on setting this is offered. The best method
is adjustment over a long period, days or weeks, carefully taking up any errors
in time noted. Connecting any external device such as a frequency counter will
load the onboard clock and render inaccurate readings, also the accuracy of most
cheaper frequency counters is likely to be less than the accuracy required for
setting the clock to +/&nbsp; 5 seconds a day, so the only choice is long term
adjustment. There is also a second problem associated with clock accuracy, and
that is that unless the chip is addressed completely within a specified minimum
time frame, the clock will gain about 1/100th of a second each time it is
addressed. More on this later. All this is coupled in my case, with the fact that
my computer is now mounted in an inaccessible totally enclosed aluminium box for
RF shielding, making long term adjustment an impractical proposition. The trimmer
was set to mid position, and over the last two weeks the clock has gained some
seven seconds. As I am only interested in hours and minutes, this is of little
importance.
</p>
<p>
The second clock constructed a few days later at work, however, behaved
in a most erratic fashion. This clock was connected to the onboard port of a
Gemini
<!-- External Link --><a href="https://80bus.co.uk.mirror.jloh.de/pages/gemini/gm811.htm" title="External Link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GM811</a><!-- /External Link -->
CPU card, and the software, which had worked correctly on the home
built clock, was reassembled to port 0B4H. Due note was taken of the warning in
the clock documentation concerning the Gemini CP/M initialisation routines
setting the port for Centronics printer operation causing rubbish to be written
into the clock registers, and these were duly bypassed. Regardless of how the
clock was initialised, it would not return from the read routine unless a finger
was placed across the crystal and then it would always return completely
repeatable rubbish. After much checking of the PIO, the software and almost
complete component substitution, the conclusion was reached that the crystal
oscillator was either running at low level or not at all, and that the only item
that could be at fault was the pcb board itself. This being patently ridiculous,
we must have missed something. None the less, the pcb was rigorously cleaned to
remove any last vestige of flux that could be causing the clock to run at low
level as it had been noted that attaching a &rsquo;scope to the crystal would produce a
visible increase in clock level, although this was probably a byproduct of the
capacitance of the &rsquo;scope probe.
</p>
<p>
Then, by accident, light started to dawn. In desparation, we had by now
adopted the very bad practice of not powering down the computer before making
component substitution. Tim removed the clock chip with all power on and replaced
it with another, and it all appeared to work. This caused some investigation of
the clock power down circuitry and battery backup. However, this was not found to
be at fault, and another lucky accident revealed the true cause. Having persuaded
the clock to work by plugging in the chip with the power on, the failed condition
could be caused by either powering up or by resetting the computer. It was
apparent that it was the reset state which caused the problem, and that under
this condition the clock chip was being fed with a register combination which not
only jammed the clock chip, but made the chip incapable of accepting new data
during any subsequent initialisation process, powering down the computer made no
difference to the jammed clock as the battery backup on the clock board took over
automatically. Once jammed the clock chip remained jammed. In fact the only way
to unjam a jammed clock chip was to remove it from the board and then plug it
back in (having initialised the port to address the chip).
</p>
<p>
On the Nascom&nbsp;2 (not Nascom&nbsp;1) and the Gemini, the PIO device is reset
when the computer is reset and also on power up, causing the PIO to go to an
input condition and to float the input/&#x200b;output pins which are left in a high
impedance state. Normally the input/&#x200b;output pins float high. By attaching our in
line port analyser, which sounds complicated but consists of no more than a CMOS
non inverting buffer sensing each port line and lighting a LED when a &lsquo;high&rsquo;
appears on the port line, we noted that the port line which addressed the clock
